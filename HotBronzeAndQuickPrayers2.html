		<i>Chapter 2</i>
		<br/><br/>
		So, this is The Bad Neighbourhood. I really feel like I have a much better understanding
		of it now that I've made a single step over some arbitrary border. Everything
		looks... Uh... Exactly the same as it did one step ago. But now that I'm
		technically on the other side, it also feels more dangerous, more sinister. I'm
		one step away from perfect safety. The moment I crossed that godsforsaken line,
		I triggered a metaphorical tripwire. A cheap booby trap made of an empty can of
		beans will surely blow my legs off now. There's barely anyone here, but I there
		are still to many eyes are on me, like I'm a poorly thought out mascot meant to
		sell contacts.<br/>
		<br/>
		But I've come this far. No point turning back now. I take another step. Then
		another. And another. With each step, I walk deeper into this horrifying place.
		It's terrible, but I don't stop. This is the only way. My hopes and dreams lie
		ahead, and they look suspiciously like dilapidated buildings and piss stained...
		Well, everything. I'm practically wading through a sea of cigarette butts and
		discarded needles.<br/>
		<br/>
		The locals seem particularly fond of corners. Figures. They keep reminding me
		that I'm in the wrong neighbourhood. How thoughtful of them. I suppose my costume
		isn't all that convincing. I light one of the cigs to make myself look more
		menacing.<br/>
		<br/>
		Gods know how many casinos and brothels I pass before I get to some seedy
		looking pub. The armed guards at the entrance really scream &quot;reputable
		establishment&quot;. I rattle off a few prayers to what can only very
		generously be described as gods and enter.<br/>
		<br/>
		I can't see my hand in front of my face through the thick tobacco smoke, and
		the dim lighting doesn't help. They probably think it hides the cokroaches. It
		doesn't. There's a giant spider fighting ring because of course there is. I also
		see folks getting stabbed left and right, hopefully for a good reason. I'd hate
		to lose my spleen because I looked at someone the wrong way. I'm just here to
		watch for now, learn about this place.<br/>
		<br/>
		I take a seat and enjoy the wonderful lack of view. I don't get to relax in the
		cosy atmosphere for long, though. I'm told to order something or leave. They've
		got all sorts of drinks, from beer to antifreeze and motor oil, but I don't
		drink on the &quot;job&quot;. Thankfully, they still sell coke, so I order
		that. They make me pay upfront, the paranoid bastards. I try to start a
		conversation with the not-so-slightly shitfaced guy sitting next to me.<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;'Scuse me.&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;The ffffuck do you wwwwwant?&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;I was wondering if you could tell me where I could buy a spleen and-&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;You aaaa... Ugh... Aaa... Yooaaah cop?&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;No, I was just-&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;Ffffuck... off!&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;I can pay if-&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		&quot;I ssshaid fughckghof!&quot;<br/>
		<br/>
		Well, that was productive. I look around to see if anyone looks like they might
		be talkative. Almost everyone's armed, and I'm getting some mean looks. Maybe
		asking potential gangsters questions isn't all that smart. I doubt Ouchara,
		Goddess of Stubbed Toes, will do much to protect me if I piss someone off. I
		think I'll just find stuff out some other way. <br/>
		<br/>
		I leave the pub, my coke unsnorted. There's still a worrying number of eyes on
		me. Guess they can sense I don't belong here. I've got to find a way to fit in
		better. Perhaps if I cackle? That's evil, right? Eh, maybe later. For now, I
		think I'll just explore this place and hope I don't get murdered. This is going
		so much worse than planned. I really should have thought this through. But
		whatever. You live (hopefully) and you learn. <br/>
		<br/>
		There's a lot of traffic going in and out of some large building. Looks
		promising. I can't quite make out what the sign says through the trees, so I
		get a bit closer aaaand... A-HA! Bingo! Just what I was looking for. The Black
		Supermarket. There are no guards at the door, but I doubt the place is
		unprotected. I say my prayers again and enter.<br/>
		<br/>
		It's surprisingly clean inside. It would look a lot like a regular supermarket
		if it didn't use blacklight for the lighting. As it is, it almost feels like a
		night club. It's surprisingly clean and well supplied. They sell all sorts of
		goods, from guns to depleted uranium. And oh, black tar heroin is on sale. Hm. Black.
		Tar. That raises some questions about the contents of my cigarettes, but
		whatever. I go to the freezer section and find all sorts of exotic meats there.
		I'm pretty sure half of those are from endangered animals. There are also some
		human organs. I really wish I knew where they got those, but maybe it's for
		better that I don't. Whoever's responsible is probably too dangerous for me to handle.<br/>
		<br/>
		The place is huge. Gods, there's even a small bakery at the back. They sell
		perfectly normal looking bread and pot brownies. I don't trust that. I bet the
		bread has razors or poison in it. Nothing here can be that innocent. A lot of
		the items in this place actually have proper packaging with fancy designs and
		text on the back. Too bad it's hard to read under this light, and it never
		lists the supplier or anything useful. It's another dead end as far as
		information goes. Learning about criminals isn't easy, who'd have thought?
		Maybe I could ask one of the cashiers if they know anything. As I approach them
		I notice they have snacks and sweets next to the cash register, just like in a
		regular superma- Aaaaaaand they're all drugs. Because of course they are. You
		know what? Fuck this place, I'm sick of this shit, I'm going home. The hero of 
		Ipswich needs a break and a new plan.<br/>
